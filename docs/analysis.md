# Overview

Creates, adds, prints and deletes elements from the queue/tree while keeping track of memory by either allocating it or destroying it.

## Tests

> Queue

- after added elements to tree I hand drew it to see if it was balanced and it was
- after deleting nodes I checked to see if the new printed version was what it was suppose to look like
- I checked to see if the rotations occured correctly
- I checked to see if the min-node returned what it was suppose to
- I checked the height to see if the height returned was correct
- tree does not re-balance itself after deletion

> Tree

- after added elements to the queue I checked to see if they were added in queue by hand drawing
- after deleted elements I checked to see if the nodes deleted were in queue by hand drawing
